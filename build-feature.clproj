Create three separate LeetCode practice projects with the following structure:

PROJECT 1: C# (.NET)
- Create a folder: leetcode-csharp/
- Initialize a .NET solution with xUnit test framework
- Structure:
  - LeetCode.Problems/ (class library project)
    - Easy/, Medium/, Hard/ folders for organizing problems
    - Each problem should be a separate class with descriptive naming (e.g., TwoSum.cs)
  - LeetCode.Tests/ (xUnit test project)
    - Corresponding test folders: Easy/, Medium/, Hard/
    - Each problem gets a test class (e.g., TwoSumTests.cs)
  - Include a README.md explaining how to run tests with `dotnet test`
- Add a sample problem (Two Sum) with tests to demonstrate the structure

PROJECT 2: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Create a folder: leetcode-javascript/
- Initialize npm project with Jest testing framework
- Structure:
  - src/
    - easy/, medium/, hard/ folders
    - Each problem in its own file (e.g., twoSum.js)
  - tests/
    - Corresponding folders: easy/, medium/, hard/
    - Test files with .test.js suffix (e.g., twoSum.test.js)
  - package.json with test script configured
  - Include a README.md explaining how to run tests with `npm test`
- Add a sample problem (Two Sum) with tests to demonstrate the structure

PROJECT 3: TypeScript
- Create a folder: leetcode-typescript/
- Initialize npm project with TypeScript and Jest configured
- Structure:
  - src/
    - easy/, medium/, hard/ folders
    - Each problem in its own file (e.g., twoSum.ts)
  - tests/
    - Corresponding folders: easy/, medium/, hard/
    - Test files with .test.ts suffix (e.g., twoSum.test.ts)
  - tsconfig.json properly configured
  - jest.config.js configured for TypeScript
  - package.json with test script configured
  - Include a README.md explaining how to run tests with `npm test`
- Add a sample problem (Two Sum) with tests to demonstrate the structure

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each README should include:
  - How to run all tests
  - How to run tests for a specific file
  - How to add new problems
  - Folder structure explanation
- Use descriptive problem naming (use the actual LeetCode problem name)
- Include comments in sample problems explaining the approach
- Make test commands simple and consistent
- Add .gitignore files appropriate for each language

Create all three projects in the current directory with clear separation.
